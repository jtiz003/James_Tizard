<h2>Call for PhD Applications</h2>
I am now accepting applications for a fully-funded PhD postion at the University of Auckland. <br><br>

<strong>Project Description:</strong> Most modern software systems are built on existing software components, such as packages, libraries, or modules. This results in a dependency on that component. When critical issues (e.g. security vulnerabilities) are discovered and fixed in a software component, the dependent software systems should include these fixes by updating to the latest version. However, changes in a software component can cause critical failures in the dependent software if the new version includes breaking changes. Each software system that depends on the component will need to update their code to accommodate these breaking changes, making it difficult to automate the update process. This project will involve a detailed study of the fixes made in response to these breaking changes, development of a comprehensive taxonomy of the types of breaking changes, identification of the types of fixes needed for each breaking change type, and development of methods to automatically fix these software failures to allow automated updates. <br><br>
