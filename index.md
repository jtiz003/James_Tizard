<h1 class="text-primary">Kia Ora, Welcome</h1>

I am a Senior Lecturer in the Department of Electrical, Computer, and Software Engineering at the University of Auckland, New Zealand,
where I lead the Human Aspects of Software Engineering Lab (HASEL), see: <a href="https://hasel.auckland.ac.nz/">https://hasel.auckland.ac.nz</a>.
The senior lecturer title is equivalent to associate professor in North American, European, and Asian universities
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_ranks_(Australia_and_New_Zealand)">see here</a>).<br>

My research is mainly in collaborative software development with a focus on the socio-technical aspects and coordination between developers.
I employ a variety of both qualitative and quantitative empirical research methods including developing new methods and tools, data mining,
repository analysis, social network analysis, interviews, and surveys.
My research has been published in the IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering (TSE), Journal of Systems and Software (JSS), Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE) Journal, Information and Software Technology (IST) Journal, and in the proceedings of the International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE), Foundations of Software Engineering (FSE), Mining Software Repositories (MSR), Requirements Engineering (RE), among others.<br>

I serve on the program committee of various conferences and workshops including ICSE, ESEC/FSE, RE, and MSR.
I am on the editorial boards of the IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, the Empirical Software Engineering Journal, and the Journal of Systems and Software.<br>

Before starting at the University of Auckland, I was a lecturer at Auckland University of Technology.
Prior to that, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Software Engineering Global interAction Lab in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Victoria, Canada.
Previously, I worked for eight years as both a software engineer and a proposal manager at Lockheed Martin.
I obtained my PhD from Drexel University in 2014.
My <a href="./publications/blincoe_thesis.pdf">PhD dissertation</a> focused on methods to facilitate timely and efficient coordination between software developers.
I recieved a MS in Information Science from Pennsylvania State University in 2008 and a BE from Villanova University in 2004.<br>

I am  originally from Philadelphia, PA, USA. I currently live in Auckland, New Zealand with my husband, Adrian, and our two children.<br>
