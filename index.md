I've recently completed my PhD in software engineering (2022). I'm now working as a researcher, and professional teaching fellow, at the University of Auckland. My current research focuses on crowd sourcing software requirements (CrowdRE), often leveraging machine learning and natural language processing techniques. A full list of my published work can be found under <a href="/publications" style="font-weight:bold">publications</a>. I'm also part of the Human Aspects of Software Engineering Lab (HASEL), check us out at <a href="https://hasel.auckland.ac.nz/" target="_blank" >https://hasel.auckland.ac.nz</a>.<br><br>

For a more reader-friendly version of my research I've started a blog on Medium, check out this 3 minute article discussing <a href="https://medium.com/@james-tizard/who-actually-writes-reviews-on-the-app-store-and-software-forums-d5a492be3fc0" target="_blank" style="font-weight:bold">who actually writes reviews on the app store?</a> I'm currently working as a teaching fellow at the University of Auckland, my <a href="/teaching" style="font-weight:bold">teaching</a> focuses on software requirements, and development methodologies.    <br><br>
