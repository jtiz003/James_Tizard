<h3 class="mb-3">About James</h3>

I live with my partner Rong in Auckland, New Zealand. Beyond my work, I'm a keen chess player, and am a member of the <a href="https://papatoetoechessclub.org.nz/">Papatoetoe chess club</a>. In 2023 I've also set myself the goal of reading 30 books, you can follow my progress on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/40883878">goodreads!</a>. As I'm writting this in January I've completed 1 of 30. So, some way to go!

I'm also a part of a book club, with my brother and two cousins, which has been going strong for several years. Our first book (of six) for 2023 is a New Zealand historical fiction called <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/75564756-k-wai">"Kāwai: For Such a Time As This" by Monty Soutar</a>.
